When `x` is a numeric vector, make sure that the `srs` matches the coordinate
values. Additionally, when the `srs` correspond to a geographic reference system
(4326, 4258), the function queries the bounding box on
[EPSG:25830](https://epsg.io/25830) - ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N. The result is
provided always in the SRS provided in `srs`.

When `x` is a [`sf`][sf::st_sf] object, the value `srs` is ignored. The query is
performed using [EPSG:25830](https://epsg.io/25830) (ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N) and
the spatial object is projected back to the SRS of the initial object.
